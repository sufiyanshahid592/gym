		<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
	<p><em><strong>Last updated 03/31/2022</strong></em></p>
<p>Gymdesk provides online management software for gyms, martial arts schools and other wellness and membership club businesses ("Services").</p>
<p>These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) apply to any use of and access to the Services by you and your Affiliates. By accessing or using the Services, you are indicating that you have read this Agreement and agree to be bound by its terms. If you do not agree with all of the terms of this Agreement, you may not access or use any Services.</p>
<p>This Agreement is effective (&ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo;) on the earlier of (a) the date you accept this Agreement by clicking an &ldquo;I Agree&rdquo; button or otherwise indicate that you accept this Agreement (including through an Order Form), or (b) the date you (or an Affiliate) first access or use the Services.</p>
<h3>1. Terms of Service</h3>
<p>By accessing the Services, you are agreeing to be bound by the Terms of Service contained in the Agreement, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing the Service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our <a href="/page/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect and use information that&rsquo;s submitted to the Services. By using the Services, you are indicating that you&rsquo;ve read the Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>
<p>Changes to the Agreement. We may, in our sole discretion, make changes to this Agreement from time to time. Any changes we make will become effective when we post a modified version of the Agreement to <a href="/page/terms">https://gymdesk.com/page/terms</a>, and we agree the changes will not be retroactive.</p>
<p>If we make any material changes to the Agreement, we&rsquo;ll notify you within the day by sending you an Email. If you continue using the Services after any changes, it means you have accepted them. If you do not agree to any changes, you must stop using the Services. It is your obligation to ensure that you read, understand and agree to the latest version of the Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Services</h3>
<p><strong>2.1 Software Services</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1.1 Access and Service Levels.</strong> Gymdesk will make the Services to which you have subscribed available to you, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. During the Subscription Term (defined below), the Software Services will meet the service levels specified in the Service Level Agreement (&ldquo;SLA&rdquo;) defined below.</p>
<p>We may temporarily suspend your access for things like scheduled maintenance, or if a natural disaster occurs. We may also change or discontinue particular features or functions of our Services at any time.</p>
<p><strong>2.1.2 Changes to Services.</strong> Notwithstanding Section 2.1.1, in addition to our rights set forth in Section 8.4, we reserve the right to suspend any Services (a) in connection with a Force Majeure event, (b) if we believe any malicious software is being used in connection with your account, or (c) during planned downtime as provided in the SLA.</p>
<p>In addition, we reserve the right to change, suspend or discontinue any features, components or functions of the Services at any time. If we make any material changes to the Software Service, we&rsquo;ll notify you within the Software Service or by sending you an email. Notwithstanding the above, we have no obligation to update or enhance any Services or to produce or release new versions of any Services.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Third Party Offerings.</strong> Although the Services may allow you to access or use Third Party Offerings (including, but not limited to: 3rd party payment providers), they are not &ldquo;Services&rdquo; under this Agreement and are not subject to any of the warranties, service commitments or other obligations with respect to Services hereunder.</p>
<p><br />The availability of any Third Party Offerings through the Services does not imply Gymdesk' endorsement of or affiliation with the provider. Gymdesk does not control Third Party Offerings and will have no liability to you or Affiliates in connection with any Third Party Offerings.</p>
<p>By using or enabling any Third Party Offering, you are expressly permitting Gymdesk to share Your Data or other information to the extent necessary to utilize the Third Party Offering. YOUR USE OF THIRD PARTY OFFERINGS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS SUBJECT TO ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, CONDITIONS AND POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SUCH THIRD PARTY OFFERINGS (SUCH AS TERMS OF SERVICE OR PRIVACY POLICIES OF THE PROVIDERS OF SUCH THIRD PARTY OFFERINGS).</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Support Services.</strong> As part of the Services you will have access to Gymdesk&rsquo; standard support services as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li>Live chat: https://gymdesk.com - 10am-6pm CST</li>
</ul>
<p>Our response time is typically within the hour during business hours M-F (CST). During off hours and weekends, it may take up to 1 day to respond.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Free Trial Services.</strong> Gymdesk may in its sole discretion offer free or trial Services from time to time at no charge. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein: (a) any free or trial&nbsp; Services are provided &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; with no warranties of any kind; and (b) Gymdesk may discontinue any free or trial Services or your ability to use such Services at any time, with or without notice and without any further obligations to you. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, free Services that have not been accessed or used for 12 consecutive months may be terminated by us.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.6 Service Level Agreement.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.6.1 Uptime Commitment.</strong> We will make the Software Service available to you on a twenty-four hour, seven days a week (24x7) basis at a rate of 99.9% (&ldquo;Uptime Requirement&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Uptime Requirement will commence on the date you first access the Software Service with a paid subscription (&ldquo;Commencement Date&rdquo;).</p>
<p><strong>2.6.2 Uptime Calculation.</strong></p>
<p>Uptime is the percentage of total possible minutes Services were available during a calendar year. Our commitment is to maintain at least 99.9% Uptime:</p>
<p>[(total minutes in a year - Downtime) / total minutes in year] &gt; 99.9%</p>
<p><strong>2.6.3 Scheduled Downtime</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we need to perform maintenance to keep Slack working smoothly. If scheduled downtime is necessary, we&rsquo;ll give you at least 48 hours advance notice. In a year, scheduled downtime will not exceed 10 hours.</p>
<p><strong>2.6.4 Service Credits</strong></p>
<p>If we fall short of our Uptime commitment, we'll apply a credit to your that is equal to 1 free month of use of the Services.</p>
<p>Service Credits are not refunds, cannot be exchanged into a cash amount, are capped at a maximum of 1 month of paid service, require you to have paid any outstanding invoices and expire upon termination of your customer contract. Service Credits are the sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Gymdesk to meet its obligations under this SLA.</p>
<p><strong>2.6.5 Refunds and cancellations</strong></p>
<p>We do not have term contracts - you may cancel your account at time by informing us of your need to cancel. If you're unhappy with our service for any reason, please let us know and we'll refund your most recent payment, up to 30 days from the payment date.</p>
